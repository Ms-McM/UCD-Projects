# The dataset chosen for my project is extracted from The Guardian.

This [dataset](http://www.theguardian.com/thecounted) contains the data behind the story Where Police Have Killed Americans In 2015 (Guardian, 2015). 

Entries from the Guardianâ€™s database on police killings are linked to census data from the American Community Survey. 

The [Guardian data](http://www.theguardian.com/thecounted) was downloaded on 7th April 2022 and contains data for 12 months of  2015.

I will create visualisations in VegaLite to analyse certain elements of the data.UCD-Projects
