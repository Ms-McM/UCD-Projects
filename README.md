# The Counted 2015, the data behind the story "Where Police Have Killed Americans in 2015" (Guardian, 2015)
The Counted is a project by the Guardian working to count the number of people killed by police and other law enforcement agencies in the United States throughout 2015 and 2016, to monitor their demographics and to tell the stories of how they died.

The database will combine Guardian reporting with verified crowdsourced information to build a more comprehensive record of such fatalities. The Counted is the most thorough public accounting for deadly use of force in the US, but it will operate as an imperfect work in progress – and will be updated by Guardian reporters and interactive journalists as frequently and as promptly as possible.

This [dataset](http://www.theguardian.com/thecounted) contains the data behind the story Where Police Have Killed Americans In 2015 (Guardian, 2015). 

Entries from the Guardian’s database on police killings are linked to census data from the American Community Survey. 

The [Guardian data](http://www.theguardian.com/thecounted) was downloaded on 7th April 2022 and contains data for 12 months of  2015.

I will create visualisations in VegaLite to analyse certain elements of the data.UCD-Projects
